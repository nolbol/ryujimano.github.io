Hello, there! My name is Ryuji Mano, and I would like to welcome and thank you for visiting my blog. I will be posting and sharing some of my code and events that are happening in my life.

On my blog, I would like to post things such as my solutions to Project Euler Problems and algorithms that I am currently learning or will be learning. I would also like to share some of the projects that I will be working on in the future.

Again, thank you for checking out my blog, and I hope you will follow and enjoy my journey and progression in the world of programming.


NOTE: Although I will be sharing my solutions to Project Euler Problems, please do not use my solutions to gain an advantage on [projecteuler.net][project-euler]. Although you may use them as hints to improve on efficiency, please solve the problems on your own, before looking at my solutions. However, if you have no interest in [projecteuler.net][project-euler] (or have already solved the problems), and you are just following my blog for pure entertainment or for educational purposes, please give them a look! Thank you!
